							<p>IM-AIM (IMage and Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) is software for cancer diagnosis. Originally, it is developed for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) diagnosis and treatment. This cancer is one of head and neck cancers. It is frequently found in Southeast Asia, particularly South China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In Thailand, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma is the 5th most common cancer in male (2010). The primary tumor normally originates in the nasopharynx which is inaccessible. Therefore, NPC is difficult to detect in the early stage.</p>
							<p>Medical images take an important role in NPC diagnosis and treatment in which useful tumor information, such as tumor size, invasion, and location can be gained. Moreover, 3D model of the tumor can be constructed from the images. In Thailand, CT scan is widely used because it is commonly available and cheaper than MR imaging. However, differentiating between the tumor and normal soft tissues in a CT image becomes difficult. This requires experience and expertise of radiologists and otolaryngologists in order to identify the tumor region in each CT slice.</p>
							<p>IM-AIM allows physicians to retrieve medical records of patients, delineate tumor regions from medical images by three options, i.e., manual, semi-automatic, and automatic segmentation. 3D model of the tumor can be constructed and displayed on the virtual skull. Physicians thus can precisely determine the tumor location and plan their treatments. In addition, IM-AIM can predict risk of NPC recurrence for individual patient with the accuracy above 70%. Follow-up time can be appropriately scheduled for each patient. Videoconferencing is another feature of IM-AIM that supports tele-consulting between a physician and an expert.</p>
							<p>IM-AIM has been extended to support bone tumor diagnosis from MR images. Currently, it has been tested and verified by radiologists and otolaryngologists at Ramathibodi hospital, Thailand.</p>

						<p>Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) normally possess three main social impairments. They are social interaction, social communication, and imagination. Because of these impairments, it is difficult for the children to live and interact with normal people. They are unable to communicate their needs and usually have repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Behavior intervention is required. Currently, the number of therapists is limited. This is contradictory to the increasing number of the children with ASD. Thai Therapeutic Robot for children with autism spectrum disorder (TTR) project is thus proposed. This project has been supported by National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), Thailand. Three robots, Chang-Tam, Chang-Phood, and Chang-Kui, are developed to aid therapists in various developmental stimulations.</p>

						<p>The robot, named Chang-Tam, is designed for assisting imitation training program. Human imitation is the basis of human social interaction skill. In order to gain this skill, autistic children are thus engaged to imitate human gestures. Chang-Tam is a humanoid robot that can encourage an autistic child to imitate basic human gestures, such as raising the left or right hand etc. In addition, it can imitate the child who sits in front of the robot.</p>

						</div>

						<p>For the other two robots, Chang-Phood and Chang-Kui, they are developed for assisting speech training purposes. These robots can recognize Thai words which are difficult to pronounce. A therapist can select predefined words for training from GUI. The training level can be set differently for each child. The robots can be used not only with autistic children but also other children who have speech disorders. Chang-Phood and Chang-Kui can response to correct and incorrect pronunciation in order to motivate the children to practice as much as possible.</p>

						<p>Chang-Kui is an improved version. It has a tablet for displaying human mouth movements. In addition, speech recognition performance has been increased.</p>

						<p>Stroke is a disease that is severe and harmful to human life. Stroke survivors often lose organ function such as difficult to move hand or arm, can’t walk, hemiplegia or paralysis etc. These are because brain is a center to command and control movement of organ. In order to recover organs’ functions, the treatment and rehabilitation of patient are continuously needed.The pattern of equipment used in rehabilitation has function that is not complex but the cost is very high. It cannot record and show progress of rehabilitation. Moreover, during physical therapy session, patients need the imagination that they are moving that organ. For example, during wrist rehabilitation, patient is trained to twist the wrist by placing the wrist on the equipment that will force patient to make a movement. While the patient is twisting the wrist, patient needs to imagine that he/she order the wrist to twist. Since neuron that is used to stimulate the wrist to move was destroyed, thus, it is necessary to simulate the nervous system to create a new path (Neural plasticity) to link the nervous system resulting from movement of patients to replace original route that was destroyed by disease. Patients must make an effort to practice, which obviously can cause boredom, fatigue and no intention to practice. The concept to bring virtual reality and haptic device to apply in the treatment has emerged to solve problem of unrealistic physical rehabilitation and to reduce the cost of each rehabilitation session. Because virtual reality and haptic device can create and simulate virtual environment that patients really perform the task such as constructing the virtual cup for the patient to try lifting.</p>
